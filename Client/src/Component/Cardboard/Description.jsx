          Cardboard boxes are an essential component of the packaging industry,
          serving a wide range of purposes from storage and shipping to retail
          display and branding. These sturdy and lightweight boxes are made of
          corrugated cardboard, which consists of multiple layers of paperboard
          that provide excellent strength and durability.
